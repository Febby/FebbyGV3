      I'm a front‑end developer and support engineer based in Medan, Indonesia. I enjoy crafting
      fast, accessible websites and applications using modern technologies like Astro. With a
      background in customer support and software engineering, I bring empathy and technical
      expertise to every project. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tools,
      writing technical blogs or helping other developers troubleshoot their issues.
